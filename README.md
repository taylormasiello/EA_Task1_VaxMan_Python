# EA Virtual Assignment 1: Vax-Man in Python
## Electronic Arts Software Engineering Virtual Experience Program

### *(In-Progress: Project PAUSED after receiving FT SWE role at EA Respawn, thus prioritizing C++ projects and learnings)*

The original task is to MODIFY an existing PacMan game made in Python. As it's my first exposure to Python, I decided to extend this task into a full project. I'm BUILDING the PacMan game in Pygame using Python from the ground up. Once completed, I'll then modify it into VaxMan per the EA program's task.

### Task 1: Create a modified Pac-Man game, called Vax-Man, in Python using Pygame

Pac-Man is one of the world's oldest computer games. In this task, we are going to pay tribute to Pac-Man. We are building a new game called Vax-Man. The rules are similar to Pac-Man with several notable exceptions:

- Vax-Man can kill a ghost if he comes into contact with it (vaccinates it).
- Contact with a ghost does not kill Vax-Man.
- Each ghost that has not yet been hit multiplies itself every 30 seconds (the infection grows).
- The goal of the game is to collect all the dots before the number of ghosts grows to 32 times the original number.
