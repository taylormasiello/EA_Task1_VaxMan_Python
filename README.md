# EA Virtual Assignment 1: Vax-Man in Python
## Electronic Arts Software Engineering Virtual Experience Program
### Task 1: Create a modified Pac-Man game, called Vax-Man, in Python using Pygame

Pac-Man is one of the world's oldest computer games. In this task, we are going to pay tribute to Pac-Man. We are building a new game called Vax-Man. The rules are similar to Pac-Man with several notable exceptions:

- Vax-Man can kill a ghost if he comes into contact with it (vaccinates it).
- Contact with a ghost does not kill Vax-Man.
- Each ghost that has not yet been hit multiplies itself every 30 seconds (the infection grows).
- The goal of the game is to collect all the dots before the number of ghosts grows to 32 times the original number.
